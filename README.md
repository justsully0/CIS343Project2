# CIS343Project2
Creating our own language

For this project, you will be creating a new programming language. This language will not be very complex (certainly not Turing complete!). Since we recently learned that Microsoft Paint is being retired people need a new way to create (incredibly) simple pictures. Our language seeks to fill that gap!

We are going to call our language Zoomjoystrong (thank you to the Product Name Generator. Zoomjoystrong will will be written in C, with the help of Flex and Bison.
